## 3. Purpose Behind the Development :hammer:
The primary objective of undertaking this project was to assess my proficiency and comprehension of CSS. I aimed to apply the knowledge gained from previous projects, pushing the boundaries to bring forth a sophisticated design that seamlessly adapts to various devices.

- **CSS Grid Integration:** Throughout the project, I extensively utilized the CSS grid system. This involved crafting responsive grids, complemented by strategically placed media queries, ensuring a design that seamlessly translates across a diverse range of devices. Notably, I employed the grid to establish a three-column layout for the presentation of food items.

- **Harnessing the Webkit Prefix:** To guarantee cross-browser compatibility, I employed my expertise in utilizing the webkit prefix. This was particularly evident in the creation of custom scroll bars for the project.

- **Incorporating Backdrop-filter and Filter Properties:** Employing a combination of the backdrop filter and filter properties, I achieved the effect of a glowing card when hovered upon. This added a visually appealing dimension to the user interface.

- **Utilizing Overflow and Hover Pseudo-Class:** By skillfully combining the overflow property with the hover pseudo-class, I successfully created an image carousel that becomes scrollable upon user interaction.

- **Leveraging CSS Animation:** The implementation of CSS animation played a crucial role in crafting an eye-catching advertisement banner situated at the top of the webpage.
